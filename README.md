# elixir hitchhikers guide

This is an ongoing elixir guide, covering the fundamentals of the elixir language and erlang VM. I created this guide due to the following reaons:

1. Elixir is not a just a language for Phoenix: Phoenix is a good framework, but elixir deserves more serious study. Many people know elixir because they are attracted by Phoenix. Thus they started to create web apps and learn both phoenix and elixir in a wrong manner.
1. Elixir is not just a language: you're not learning a language, you're learning an operating system
1. There are too many superficial guides, without touching important pieces: fundamentals, fundamentals, fundamentals!
1. OTP is not a rocket science, it's your friend!
